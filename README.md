## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- A computer with internet access
- Basic computer skills (browsing, file management)
- No prior programming experience required!

### Getting Started
1. **Start with Git**: Learn version control first
2. **Set up Cursor**: Your AI coding companion
3. **Follow the learning path**: Go through each section systematically
4. **Practice regularly**: Code every day, even if just for 30 minutes
5. **Build projects**: Apply what you learn in real projects

## 📖 How to Use This Guide

### For Each Topic:
1. **Read the Theory section** first to understand concepts
2. **Do the Practice exercises** to apply what you learned
