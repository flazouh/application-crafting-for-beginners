## Understanding Web Development Concepts

### HTML: The Structure
HTML provides the skeleton of your web pages.

**Elements**: Building blocks like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<img>`
**Semantics**: Meaningful tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`
**Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly markup

### CSS: The Styling
CSS controls how your HTML looks and feels.

**Selectors**: How to target HTML elements
**Properties**: Colors, fonts, spacing, layout
**Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### JavaScript: The Interactivity
JavaScript makes your websites dynamic and interactive.

**Variables**: Storing and manipulating data
**Functions**: Reusable blocks of code
**Events**: Responding to user actions
**DOM Manipulation**: Changing page content dynamically

## Project Organization Principles

### File Structure Best Practices

```
📁 project-name
├── 📄 index.html          ← Main page
├── 📄 styles.css          ← All styling
├── 📄 script.js           ← All JavaScript
└── 📁 assets             ← Images, fonts, etc.
    ├── 📁 images
    └── 📁 fonts
```

### Why Organization Matters

**Maintainability**: Easy to find and modify code
**Collaboration**: Team members understand the structure
**Scalability**: Project can grow without becoming messy

## Error Handling and Debugging

### Common Error Types

**Syntax Errors**: Code grammar mistakes
**Logic Errors**: Code runs but doesn't work as expected
**Runtime Errors**: Code fails during execution

### AI Debugging Workflow

1. **Identify Error**: See error message or unexpected behavior
2. **Ask AI**: "What's causing this error?"
3. **Understand**: AI explains the problem
4. **Fix**: AI suggests or implements the solution
5. **Learn**: Understand why it happened
