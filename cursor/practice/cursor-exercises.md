## Exercise 10: Code Refactoring

### Improving Code Quality

**Original Code:**
```javascript
function calculateGrade(score) {
   if (score >= 90) {
       return "A";
   } else if (score >= 80) {
       return "B";
   } else if (score >= 70) {
       return "C";
   } else if (score >= 60) {
       return "D";
   } else {
       return "F";
   }
}
```

**Ask AI:** *"Refactor this function to be more readable and maintainable"*

**AI might suggest:**
```javascript
function calculateGrade(score) {
   const gradeThresholds = [
       { min: 90, grade: 'A' },
       { min: 80, grade: 'B' },
       { min: 70, grade: 'C' },
       { min: 60, grade: 'D' }
   ];

   for (const threshold of gradeThresholds) {
       if (score >= threshold.min) {
           return threshold.grade;
       }
   }

   return 'F';
}
```
