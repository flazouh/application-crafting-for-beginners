# Git Beginner Guide: Version Control Made Simple

## What is Git? 🤔

Imagine you're writing a story, but you want to save different versions as you make changes. Git is like having infinite "save points" for your code! It's a system that tracks changes to files over time, so you can:

- Go back to previous versions if something breaks
- Work with others without overwriting each other's work
- Keep a complete history of what changed and when

## Basic Concepts

### Repository (Repo)
A repository is like a project folder that Git is watching. It's where all your files and their history are stored.

```
📁 MyProject (Repository)
├── 📄 file1.txt
├── 📄 file2.txt
└── 📄 .git/ (hidden folder with history)
```

### Commits
A commit is like taking a snapshot of your project at a specific moment. Each commit has:
- A unique ID (like a fingerprint)
- A message describing what changed
- Date and time
- Who made the change

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Git

**Windows:**
1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Download and run the installer
3. Follow the default settings

**Mac:**
```bash
# Open Terminal and run:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

### Step 2: Configure Git

Open Terminal/Command Prompt and tell Git who you are:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Step 3: Create Your First Repository

1. Create a new folder for your project:
```bash
mkdir my-first-project
cd my-first-project
```

2. Initialize Git in that folder:
```bash
git init
```

3. Create a simple file:
```bash
echo "# My First Project" > README.md
```

## Basic Workflow

### The Three Main Commands

```
Working Directory ──git add──> Staging Area ──git commit──> Repository
       │                        │                        │
   Edit files ──────────────git add───────────────────git commit
```

### Step 4: Make Your First Commit

1. Check what files Git sees:
```bash
git status
```

2. Add your file to staging:
```bash
git add README.md
# or add all files: git add .
```

3. Commit (save) your changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Add initial README file"
```

## Working with Changes

### Check What's Changed
```bash
git status          # See current status
git diff           # See what changed in files
git log            # See commit history
```

### Make Changes and Save Them

1. Edit your README.md file
2. Check what changed:
```bash
git status
git diff
```

3. Add and commit:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with project description"
```

## Branching: Parallel Versions

Branches are like having multiple timelines for your project.

```
main (master)
├── feature-login
├── bug-fix-header
└── experimental-ui
```

### Create and Switch Branches

```bash
# Create new branch
git branch feature-login

# Switch to it
git checkout feature-login
# or: git switch feature-login

# Create and switch in one command
git checkout -b feature-login
```

### Merge Branches Back

When your feature is done, merge it back to main:

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature-login
```

## Remote Repositories (GitHub/GitLab)

### Connect to GitHub

1. Create account at github.com
2. Create new repository on GitHub
3. Connect your local repo:

```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Pull Changes from Others

```bash
# Download latest changes
git pull

# or separately:
git fetch  # download changes
git merge  # merge them in
```

## Common Scenarios

### Undo Last Commit (but keep changes)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Undo Last Commit (delete changes)
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Go Back to Specific Commit
```bash
git checkout <commit-id>
```

### See Who Changed What
```bash
git blame filename.txt
```

## Git Workflow Summary

```
1. Edit files in working directory
2. git add <files>           # Stage changes
3. git commit -m "message"   # Save snapshot
4. git push                  # Share with team
5. git pull                  # Get team changes
```

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Commit often**: Make small, frequent commits with clear messages
2. **Write good commit messages**: "Add user login" not "fix stuff"
3. **Use branches**: Keep main branch clean, work on features separately
4. **Pull before pushing**: Always get latest changes first
5. **Don't panic**: Git keeps everything, you can always go back
